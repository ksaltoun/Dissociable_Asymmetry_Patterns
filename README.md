Each asymmetry pattern folder contains the following:
- Feature contributions which comprise the asymmetry pattern 
    - Glass brain plots for each level of brain organization (cerebellum, white matter tracts, and grey matter volumes) 
    - Exact feature contributions for all 85 brain features which contribute to the asymmetry pattern
- Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) Results
    - All phenotype associations (977) p values and associated phenotype 
    - All phenotypes above the False Discovery Rate (FDR) Threshold, grouped by category
    - Manhattan Plots as a visual summary of PheWAS Results
- Age/Sex Analysis
